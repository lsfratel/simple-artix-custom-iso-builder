# Chogori themes

Chogori will be a set of dark themes for Visual Studio Code inspired in part by (and based on) another
VSCode theme called [Grueling Hare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pureux.grueling-hare),
which shows that fewer colors make for more readable code, and by the dark variant of the
[Qogir family of themes](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1230631/) for XFCE, GNOME, Gtk and
others. You will recognise the orange, mint and blue highlights below as coming from the
Qogir Ubuntu, Manjaro and Blue themes, and I've also added the red highlight from the [Numix project](https://numixproject.github.io/),
and a pink and a yellow that I thought looked nice.

For now there is one version ready, Darkest, with a few different highlight colors. Later I may add Dark and Variant.
